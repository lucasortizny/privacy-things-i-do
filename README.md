# What do I do for privacy?

## General Summary

This is just supposed to be a document that reflects my current security practices. This is in NO WAY meant to be the way to go about things. But I've made some sacrifices for the purposes of ease of use. 

### Signal (Messaging)

When it comes to messaging, I utilize Signal if I need a secure channel. I don't know what information WhatsApp or other applications collect even though they use (I think) the Signal protocol but Signal is nice for two reasons: 
end-to-end encryption with Post Quantum resistance, and the ability to use usernames and then toss it out when finished using it. It is extremely useful for that reason and it's quite secure. Just make sure you disable the ability 
to be looked up someone via Phone Number in the settings. 

### Email (Open-sourced Client + Any Hosting Provider + OpenPGP)

I pay for a hosting provider to host my emails (Namecheap) and I have different email inboxes. For email client, I utilize Thunderbird Desktop (or for mobile, Thunderbird Mobile + OpenKeychain) in order to connect to my inboxes. 
Then from within the client, I modify my inboxes and assign an OpenPGP key to it. It will usually be generated by Thunderbird Desktop (or if on mobile, by the OpenKeychain).

Key expiration here is set for a decade but for most optimal security, lower that expiration and ROTATE MORE FREQUENTLY. In addition, I ensure I sign emails with the key and encrypt if absolutely necessary. 

### VPN (Wireguard/Proton VPN)

I have two VPNs being used in my day-to-day. Usually, when I go to the office, I run a VPN connection all the time connected to my home internet. It's a server running Wireguard in a Docker container running 24/7 to handle that traffic. 
But when it comes to something more sensitive, I have Proton VPN so I can move my internet traffic over to other countries outside of the jurisdiction of the US. That's the general idea, I seldomly use it.
